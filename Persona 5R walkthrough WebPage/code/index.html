        <h1>Changing the world takes heart... and time. A lot of time</h1>
        <p>Persona 5 Royal is a +100 hours game, but also has a calendar-based system, which means you will have limited
            time to complete the story, as well as to interact with your confidants and perform activities (some of
            these will only be available on certain days of the week). That is why it is important to manage your time
            well, because history has several endings, which will depend not only on your decisions, but also on the
            rank you have achieved with some of your confidants.</p>
        <!--game description-->
        <h2>What is Persona 5 Royal about?</h2>
        <p>The game revolves around the Metaverse, which is, in essence, the physical manifestation of people’s
            subconscious desires.
            <br><br>History does not hesitate to make a critical reference to the problems existing in society; the
            abuse of power, excessive ambition, envy, narcissism, harassment, sexism... and how young people are most
            affected by the distorted desires of adults; and the fear, pain, insecurity and trauma they cause in them.
            <br><br>In the game you will play as a teenager, falsely accused, who has the ability to enter the
            metaverse. Your mission will be to enter together with your team, the Phantom Thieves, into the subconscious
            of those who have been dragged by their desires and steal the essence of them, because if you do the
            cognition of those people will change, causing them to repent and confess their crimes. In addition, during
            your day-to-day life you will have to act like a normal teenager, studying, exploring the city and carrying
            out your tasks.
            <br><br>In the Metaverse, you will have to fight the Shadows with your Persona. Personas are formed by
            individuals who find themselves in the Metaverse and are dealing with feelings of frustration of being
            wronged or taken advantage of. Should the person decide to rebel and take revenge, their Shadow Self calls
            out to them, forming a mask on their face. Ripping this mask from their face formalizes their contract,
            causing the Shadow Self to turn into their Persona and take form.
        </p>
        <!--third semestre explanation-->
        <h2>How to unlock the third semestre</h2>
        <p>The new semester is an expansion of the story of the original game, and begins in the evening of December 24
            if all the necessary conditions are met. To unlock it, you must get the following confidants up to max rank
            during the main story.
            <br><br>The Councillor Confidant unlocks as part of the story when you meet Takuto Maruki on May 13; and
            from there you'll have until November 17 to work your bond with him up to Rank 9. Rank 10 unlocks
            automatically on November 18 should you succeed.
            <br><br>The Faith Confidant unlocks as part of the story when you meet Kasumi Yoshizawa on May 30. Her
            hangout days each week are limited but you have until December to get her confidant rank up to 5, and that
            should be plenty of time.
            <br><br>The Justice Confidant unlocks as part of the story when you meet Goro Akechi on June 10, and you
            have to get your bond with him up to Rank 8 before November 18. This confidant takes more work to max out
            than the other two, as it requires you to rank up your social stats to a certain point to progress. That
            being said, your Charm has to be at Level 3 to progress to Rank 3 and Level 4 Knowledge is necessary to
            progress to Rank 7.
